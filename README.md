example-wpull-seesaw-project
============================

This is an example Seesaw project for demonstrating the use of Wpull instead of Wget+Lua.

Installing Wpull
================

`warrior-install.sh` is to be run by the Warriors.

Manual script users can install Wpull by following the install instructions at http://wpull.readthedocs.org/. (The install script works on Linux, but the download is relatively large.)
